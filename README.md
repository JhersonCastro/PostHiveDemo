<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](http://posthive.tryasp.net/)

PostHive is a social platform prototype designed for university purposes, aimed at facilitating the creation and interaction with user-generated content. The project provides a structured, simple, and safe environment for users to express their ideas through posts and comments.

The platform is designed to be open, intuitive, and responsive, allowing users to interact with others in a shared space that prioritizes accessibility and ethical digital practices.

### General Objective

To design and implement an interactive web platform where users can register, publish content, and engage with others through comments, promoting a respectful community through basic behavioral guidelines.

### Specific Objectives

- Develop a secure and functional authentication system using **bcrypt**
- Implement features to create, edit, and delete public posts
- Create a comment system associated with each post
- Design a responsive and user-friendly interface for both mobile and desktop devices
- Apply best practices in security and accessibility throughout the platform

### Project Scope

**Included:**
- User registration and login system
- Content creation, editing, and visualization
- Comment functionality on posts
- Responsive UI using MudBlazor and Bootstrap

**Not included:**
- Administrative moderation tools
- User reports or sanctions
- Private messaging system
- Social media integration
- Monetization or advertisements

### Core Features

- üîê **Authentication:** Register, log in, and recover accounts using secure bcrypt-hashed passwords  
- üìù **Posts:** Create, edit, delete, and view user-generated content  
- üí¨ **Comments:** Comment on posts with simple interaction features  
- üì± **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout using MudBlazor and Bootstrap  
- üíæ **Database:** SQL Server managed with Entity Framework

### System Architecture

The platform follows a layered architecture:

- **Frontend:** Developed using Blazor WebAssembly with MudBlazor for UI components and Bootstrap for additional styling
- **Backend:** Built with C# using Blazor Server or WebAssembly features
- **Database:** Relational model implemented using SQL Server, accessed through Entity Framework Core
- **Security:** Authentication handled via bcrypt, with proper input validation and secure data handling practices

### Technologies Used

| Component       | Technology                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend        | Blazor + MudBlazor + Bootstrap  |
| Backend         | C# with Blazor                  |
| Database        | SQL Server + Entity Framework   |
| Authentication  | bcrypt                          |

### Ethical and Security Considerations

The system promotes core digital ethics: inclusion, respect, and responsible freedom of expression. Although there is no active moderation system, it is assumed that users will adhere to basic community norms. Personal data is protected through secure development practices and privacy-oriented design.

### Conclusion

PostHive aims to be a practical demonstration of modern web development using Blazor and C#, focusing on user interaction, ethical responsibility, and clean architectural design. The project serves as a functional educational tool, highlighting the creation of a social platform with real-world patterns, adapted to academic requirements and constraints.
